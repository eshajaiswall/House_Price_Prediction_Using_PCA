# House_Price_Prediction_Using_PCA
**Introduction :-**
House Price Prediction is a significant area in real estate and economic forecasting. This project aims to predict house prices using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and improve model performance. PCA helps in transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) :-**
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving most of the variance in the data.

**Model Building :-**
We use a regression model to predict house prices based on the principal components obtained from PCA.

**Conclusion :-**
This project demonstrates the application of PCA in reducing the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining most of the information. By doing so, we improve the efficiency and performance of our regression model for predicting house prices.
